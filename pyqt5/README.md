#### Installing dependencies with virtual environment  (recommended)
To create virtual environment and install dependencies:
In terminal
```
python -m venv venv
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
From there, you can run the main.py file after activing the virtual environment.

#### Installing dependencies directly
If you do not have venv and would rather install all dependencies directly
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Running the app
First activate the venv if using a virtual environment, ignore if not
```
python main.py
```
